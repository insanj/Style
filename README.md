# Style

Personally developed style guides for software semantics. These have grown from general, syntactic instructions for programming languages to broader and more significant design values concerning particular software. 

Traditionally, companies like [Github](https://github.com/github/objective-c-style-guide), [Google](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/objcguide.xml), and [The New York Times](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide) have all written their own software style guides, and reinterpreted and expanded on [Apple's own "Code Naming Basics"](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001281-BBCHBFAH). What follows is partially a collection of all specific code formatting styles I use in the majority of my codebases, and partially an accumulating set of templates and philosophical guidelines for work in several applications (inspired by [Beautiful Code](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047)).

All guides here are meant to be frequently amended and augmented to conform to new standards, technologies, and trends â€” as well as develop the most writable, readable, and usable code.
